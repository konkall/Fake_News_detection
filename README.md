# Fake_News_detection
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news and often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. 

In this project we will try to successfully discern fake news by using classification techniques. This process is divided into four major tasks: Preprocessing, Data overview, Feature extraction, and Classification.
